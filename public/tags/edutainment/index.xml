      <description>Johannesburg&amp;rsquo;s public libraries are hubs of education, giving residents access to books, magazines and audio-visual materials. Besides lending out material, the City’s libraries offer a wide-range of other services including literacy classes, storytelling sessions for youngsters, classroom support, gatherings for older residents and literary competitions. They are also the venues for lectures, exhibitions, and talks. Libraries can be found across the City’s seven regions, and mobile satellite centres also travel to far-flung areas.</description>

      <description>About Book Dash believes that every child should own one hundred books by the age of five. To that end, we gather creative professionals who volunteer to create new, African storybooks that anyone can freely translate, print and distribute. In this way, we have vastly reduced the costs involved in putting high-quality books in children’s hands and hearts.

Data set available: 20 different books from the Book Dash collection</description>
